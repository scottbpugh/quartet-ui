# Number Range Plugin

## Overview

The Number Range plugin allows you to interact with the SerialBox QU4RTET server module. For more information on SerialBox concepts, please see the [SerialBox documentation](https://serial-lab.gitlab.io/serialbox/index.html).

## Creating a Pool

For more information on basic number range management concepts in QU4RTET please see the [SerialBox Getting Started page](https://serial-lab.gitlab.io/serialbox/basic_concepts/index.html).

To create a pool on a given server with SerialBox enabled, click on a server node in the navigation tree and right-click on the "Serial Number Range" menu item:

Finally, click on "Add a New Pool" to get into the pool creation form.

### Filling the Pool Form

Three fields are required and one is optional to create a pool.

* ReadableName: A humain-readable name for use in the QU4RTET Desktop App, reports, ...
* API Key: A URL/API-friendly unique key for use in API calls.
* Active: Whether or not this pool is in use. A pool that is not active cannot be used in API calls such as number allocation.
* Threshold: An optional field, the maximum number of items that can be requested from this pool at once. The default if left blank is 50000.

After filling the form, click Submit.

You will then see your new pool appear on the Number Range listing screen:

## Creating a new Region

Out of the box, you may create two types of regions:

* Sequential Regions
* Randomized Regions

A pool cannot mix its region types once a first region has been created. For instance, if you decide to create a randomized region for a given pool, you will only be able to create additional randomized regions for this pool.

### Creating a Sequential Region

Sequential regions yield numbers in sequential order. To create a new sequential region, right-click on the Serial Number Pools node under your server tree.

Choose the "Add a New Sequential Region" item in the menu.

#### Filling the Sequential Region Form

Similarly to the Pool Creation form, the Sequential Region form requires a number of values:

* ReadableName: A human-readable name for use in the QU4RTET Desktop App, API descriptions, and reports generated by the QU4RTET backend.

* API Key: A URL/API-friendly unique key for use in API calls.

* Active: Whether or not this region is still in use and has remaining number to yield.

* Order: The order in which this region will be consumed as numbers are issued from the pool overall.

* Starting Number: The starting number for this region.

* Ending Number: The ending number for this region.

* State: The State represents the current number in use if an API request were to come in now.

Upon Submitting the form, a new region object will be represented on the Pool Detail screen. It contains the main information regarding the pool.

### Number Allocation on Sequential Regions

While number allocations typically happen via the REST API, the QU4RTET user interface also allows you to allocate numbers and generate an output in a number of file formats.
To start allocating from the pool, right click on the pool name in the navigation tree and click on "Allocate from Pool":

A pop up window will appear on top of the pool detail screen:

You can enter the quantity that you want to allocate, in this example, we choose to allocate 300 numbers. You can also select the Export Type. Currently supported are the JSON format, CSV (which can be opened with Microsoft Excel), and XML.

After clicking the Allocate from Pool, a toaster will appear on the bottom right of the screen to detail the success or failure of the operation, and a save prompt will allow you to keep the file locally on your system:
