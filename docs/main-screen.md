# Getting Around the QU4RTET Desktop App

## QU4RTET Main Screen

The application window is divided into three visual components:

* The top bar
* The navigation sidebar (left)
* The main content panel (right)

When you open the QU4RTET application, a single window will open on your desktop. It contains links to resources on QU4RTET as well as the most common actions and shortcuts:

## Theme Preferences

At any moment, you can change the overall theme of the application by clicking on the right drop-down in the top bar:

There are many themes to choose from, from very light (polar), to very dark (dark brown theme.)

## Language Preferences

QU4RTET fully supports internationalization and localization. We currently offer full support of US English, and partial support of French (in progress.)

## Left Navigation Sidebar

The navigation sidebar on the left lists all your servers at the top level, you can dive into each server by clicking on the left chevron to expand all modules available on the servers. Clicking on one will take you to a specific screen. Most items in the navigation provide a context menu with specific actions when right clicking on them.
