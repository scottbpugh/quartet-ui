### Desktop Client Software

The QU4RTET User Interface allows many users to interact with all the modules and the core QU4RTET backend server, for all your Level 4 Serialization administration needs. You can connect to many QU4RTET server instances (for example, a test server and a QA server) using the same client.

The QU4RTET client can be installed on any modern computer.
The supported operating systems are:

* Mac OS X
* Microsoft Windows
* GNU/Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian)

You may use NPM to install the client and run it in development mode, or use a binary build to install the software in production mode.
