### What is the QU4RTET Desktop client

The QU4RTET Desktop application allows you to interactthe core QU4RTET software and its modules for all your Level 4 Serialization administration needs.

Using the QU4RTET Desktop application, you can:

* connect to many QU4RTET server instances (for example, a test server and a QA server) using the same client and navigate between server instances from the same window.

* create number ranges and allocate numbers on the fly.

* upload files for processing after defining rules and steps.

* look up EPCIS events and entries in the repository of each of your QU4RTET L4 instances.

### Installation

The QU4RTET client can be installed on any modern computer.
The supported operating systems are:

* Mac OS X
* Microsoft Windows
* GNU/Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian)

You may use the git repository or NPM to install the client and run it in development mode, or use a binary build (.dmg, .exe, or .deb, for example) to install the software in production mode.
